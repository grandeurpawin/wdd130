        <p>Hello everyone! My name is Grandeur Pawin, currently living here in Davao City, Philippines. One of my hobbies is to play chess because it helps me to develop plans with critical thinking. Currently, I am studying Web Development at BYU-Pathway and it is very exciting to learn how websites developed an I'm hoping that I can build some too later on. Im so excited on what the future holds for me as I study diligently and faithfully! Take care always and have a great journey. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. </p>
